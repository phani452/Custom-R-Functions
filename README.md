# Custom-R-Functons
# 1.Function_for_univariate_analysis:
function which performs the univariate analysis.If variable is continous histogram and
Boxplot are plotted and if variable is categorical barplot and pie chart are plotted
and all graphs are stored in the user preferd folder.If we just pass a dataframe function
plots the necessary graphs and stores as images in the folder.

# 2.Function_for_chisqtest_t-test:
A function where every thing comes into one place A function which conducts the 
chisquare test and t-test and  returns  the respective p valueand also does the 
univariate analysis and returns the histogram for the numerical columns and the bar plot 
for the categorical columns and stores the all graphs as images in the user specified folders.

# 3.Function_for_EDA:
# Automating EDA process
The function can be used :
### For Binary classification problem
### For Continous target variable
### The function plots and saves univariate and Bivariate analysis graphs
### Function gives us the importance of the variables
### The function imputes missing values using KNN
### The function gives the number outlier in variables
